# Tour-guide-java-object-oriented-programming


Created a Java project for a Tour Guide using Object-Oriented Programming concepts like inheritance and polymorphism. This means organizing different types of locations and tours in a logical way and allowing for flexible behavior and adding new features easily.

Designed classes for locations, user preferences, and various tour packages like Season Tour, Economic Tour, and Month Tour. Also included a billing system to accurately calculate and display tour costs.

The project uses many fundamental Java concepts like threads, strings, and interfaces.

Received praise for delivering a user-friendly and comprehensive tour guide solution that meets the needs of various users. You can download and run the Java file named "TourPackage" to enjoy your tour.
